= Tipsy

Tipsy is a small Rack-based server inspired by gems like StaticMatic and Serve. Its purpose is to aid development of static sites by providing 
Rails-esque style templating and helpers. Various template types are supported via the Tilt gem, and assets are served via Sprockets, essentially giving you 
a miniture Rails "view-only" environment. 

=== Notes

Tipsy was developed for personal/internal use but feature/pull requests are gladly accepted. It is not designed to function in any kind of production 
environment. When ready to upload files to a production environment, build the project and upload the result.
